Machine learning program to predict the outcome of tennis single matches. 
Tennis Prediction Programs (.py)
This repository contains a collection of Python programs for exploring tennis data and performing machine learning tasks. These programs are designed to help tennis enthusiasts analyze and preprocess tennis data, extract useful information, and make predictions using machine learning techniques.

# Programs

1. Data Finder: This program allows you to search and locate specific ATP tennis data. It provides a user-friendly interface for finding and accessing specific datasets.
2. ATP Rankings: This program give you access to the latest ATP ranking.
3. ATP Players Statistics: This program provides comprehensive statistics for ATP players. You can obtain detailed information about player performance, including match results, statistics, and various metrics.
4. Data Extractor for Machine Learning: This program helps in extracting relevant features and data for machine learning tasks. It preprocesses the raw data and prepares it for further analysis and modeling. You need to specify Players name, name and surface.
5.  Data Preprocessing for Machine Learning: This program focuses on data preprocessing techniques for machine learning. It cleans the data, handles missing values, performs feature engineering, and prepares the dataset for training machine learning models.
6. Prediction by Machine Learning: (Currently not functional) This program is intended to make predictions using machine learning algorithms. It aims to train a random forest classifier on tennis data and predict the outcomes of tennis matches based on the input provided. Please note that this program is still a work in progress and is not functional at the moment.

All the programs can be easily launched by the Tennis_Menu.py program.

Note: The programs assume that the necessary data files are located in the specified directory (/Users/charles/Desktop/TENNIS/Data). Adjust the file paths accordingly to your own location.

# Usage
To use these programs, follow these steps:
1. Clone the repository to your local machine.
2. Install the required dependencies mentioned in the documentation.
3. Run the desired Python program by executing the corresponding file.
4. Follow the program prompts or instructions to interact with the data and perform the desired task.
Feel free to explore and modify the code to suit your specific needs. Contributions and suggestions are welcome.
